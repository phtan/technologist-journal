### A quick note on so-called "neutral terms"

Certain software-professionals are replacing 
industry-parlance such as "master branch", "black-list" and 
"white-list". (I refer to recent news).

I doubt that it can eradicate racism, White supremacy
and anti-Black sentiments.

Those replacements are superficial changes. I would be curious to know
how industry-professionals plan to effect change on a deeper level.

For the time being, I avoid making such changes, which are naive (or,
dare I say, foolish) at best, and hypocritical at worst.
