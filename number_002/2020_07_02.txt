# An Issue/Article On People

### Interesting people I've discovered on the Internet

- Dylan Beattie, who gave a talk titled "The art of code"
- Cassidy Williams, who runs a email-newsletter called "Rendezvous with
Cassidoo"

### Tip jars

I just thought I would make a list of people whom I know are open to
donations. Why? Why not?

This list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Suggestion: ask them what they would do with the money, why don't you.

I list in no particular order:

- Mate Soos. (https://www.msoos.org/)
- Colin White. (https://colinwhite.me/)
- "Kody (Andr√© F.)". (https://kdy.ch/)
- Darius Kazemi. (https://tinysubversions.com/)
- "Frost". (https://frostming.com/about)
- Gamliel Fishkin. (https://fishk.in/payments.html)
- "Yukari Peerless". (https://mastodon.social/@yukari)
