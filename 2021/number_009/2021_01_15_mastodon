### What is Mastodon, the social network?


It is a social network you can operate yourself.


Take Facebook, for example. we can create an account at Facebook, but our data lives at Facebook. Whatever photos and posts we make on Facebook, goes into Facebook's hands.


But with Mastodon, we can choose where we put our data. 
You can put your data (i.e. posts, photos, etc.) in your own computer. Or if you trust others, you can put your data in their computers. You have a choice.


In a way, Mastodon is like email. Suppose you use Gmail, and I use Hotmail/Outlook. Your data is in Gmail's hands, and my data is in Hotmail's hands. But we can still send emails to each other.


The name for this kind of email-like system is "de-centralised". Facebook is a centralised network. Mastodon is de-centralised.
