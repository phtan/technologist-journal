Quick notes on food that appears in the movie Raya And The Last Dragon!

- in the second half of the movie, Raya says "I wish I could have a meal
 with my Pa", or something like that. The camera shows a close-up of a 
bowl of soup. It looks like Tom Yum Soup, a spicy Thai dish! Appears to
 be a non-seafood version.
- early on, we meet a chef who lives on a boat! The chef makes congee! 
I grew up with congee ðŸ˜‹ it may be food of Cantonese (a sub-group 
of Chinese)
