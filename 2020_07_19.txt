# The story behind Rockstar, a programming language

I heard this story from Dylan Beattie's 2020 talk, "The Art of Code."
(https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U).

Various people got rather sick of jobs that called for "rockstar developers"

Someone tweeted, "someone should make a programming language called Rockstar". 
By extension, if we program in that language, we are all Rockstar developers

Someone else (Dylan Beattie) saw that tweet, and thought it was 
something he was put on Earth to do. (Yeah, quite a dramatic moment for 
Dylan).

Several drinks at a bar later, Dylan coded up the language Rockstar.
