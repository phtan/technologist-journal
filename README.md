Journal of a part-time technologist

### Philosophy

I am influenced by [the software-building rules of Devine and Rekka 
of Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/philosophy.html).

I quote:

> *Offline First*.  We build and design our software to work offline 
first. They will never need online resources to function properly ...
*Past Proofing*. We build simple tools to tackle specific tasks... 
We target 20 years old hardware as to encourage recyclism and 
discourage the consumption of fashionable electronics...
*Freedom*. We release free and open-source programs so that they can 
be studied, inspected and repaired by anyone, anywhere.

Emphasis appears in the original.

### Assumptions

- The viewer of this journal is familiar enough with Github, to view
entries in my journal.
- A file of extension .txt is sufficient for my purposes in maintaining
this journal.

### Design choices

- Each line in any given entry in my journal observes a character limit
of 72 characters. This is to make it easier to read, for a viewer who does not
have Word Wrap enabled in his chosen software (that he uses to view
my entries).
- I avoid publishing my journal as a web-page or a web-site. That is,
with a .html extension. Because I want to write an entry using 
bare-minimum software on Windows OS. (For now, that software is
Notepad++). And because I find (manually) writing HTML files too much 
of hassle. A .txt file works well enough for me.
- I avoid using Markdown for entries in my journal. I want my 
files/entries to be readable and writable with the bare-minimum 
software. I choose to do away with software that parses Markdown,
as much as I can.
- Letters To The Editor can be achieved through Issues on Github.
