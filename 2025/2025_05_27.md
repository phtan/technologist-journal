On marriage:

"To be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. To be known and not loved is our greatest fear. But to be fully known and truly loved is, well, a lot like being loved by God. It is what we need more than anything. It liberates us from pretense, humbles us out of our self-righteousness, and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us."

- Timothy Keller, "The Meaning of Marriage: Facing the Complexities of Commitment with the Wisdom of God"
