From a certain Tony:

"Life is a place of service. Joy can be real only if people look upon their life as a service and have a definite object in life outside themselves and their personal happiness." – Leo Tolstoy

Response from a certain Kelvin:

心外無物，心無罣礙。

Objects may be a helpful aid in the quest for meaning, but attaching too much of a significance to them may resurface another crisis of meaning should that object cease to be just as with all things in life being finite. The subject/object distinction and duality is itself another hurdle to overcome.
