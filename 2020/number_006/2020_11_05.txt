What kind of software do I make?

Well, previously I did commissioned work.

Now, I am just coding programs that can help me out. (I.e. self-commissioned)

Here's a bit about my work:

I've contributed to programs in the programming languages C++ and Java, to name a few.

My previous employers include:

- Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, or SMART. ((https://smart.mit.edu/ ).

At SMART, I worked on a program that simulated traffic (eg. Cars, freight vehicles, etc).

- Asia Centre for Social Entrepreneurship & Philanthropy, or ACSEP.

At ACSEP, I made a custom plug-in for WordPress that my supervisor wanted.
