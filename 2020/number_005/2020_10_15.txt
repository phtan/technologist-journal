Did you guys know you can do the following with an email-address at Gmail?

Suppose you have the email-address john.doe@gmail.com. 

And suppose you go to a Meetup that asks for your email-address. You can 
give it as: 

john.doe+meetup@gmail.com

And for a conference:

john.doe+conf@gmail.com

Any emails sent to the above two email-addresses appear in the same inbox.

Neat, huh?

This way, you can find out how someone got your email address.
