Re. The article "Faster Internet is impossible", in Low Tech Magazine.

Since the article mentions applications gobbling up any available bandwidth- 

I thought it worthwhile to mention this developer, Nolan Lawson. His 
public writings (i.e. blog) feature his interest in what he calls "web performance".

I've met developers - whom I shall not name - who say, "we are going to 
eat up the resources we have on the user's computer because we can 
afford it". And then I've stumbled onto Nolan's blog (and made a minor 
Pull Request to one of his repos).

An example of his blog-post, below.

"I’m very satisfied with Svelte v2. It’s fast, lightweight, and does 
everything I need it to....

"And oh yeah: Svelte really is lightweight. Pinafore only loads 32KB of 
compressed JavaScript for the landing page, and 137KB for the Home 
timeline. The total size of all JS assets is under 300KB compressed..."
