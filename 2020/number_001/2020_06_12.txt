I've just discovered https://sourcerer.io .

Apparently tries to answer "what does your code say about you?".

For me, it is a step towards solving a problem I have: how can I talk 
about my code-contributions on GitHub, to a non-technical audience?

I guess its input is your repos (which can be your public ones on GitHub
 - or apparently your offline repos are acceptable as input too), and 
 its output is various graphs, visualisations (is it called 
 "analytics") - and "fun facts".

Like, apparently, my code says I am most productive on Mondays. *shrugs*

@brechtmissotten asked: Just wonder if they keep your code somewhere.. 
in other words, might not be safe to run local repos if those are 
private and confidential.

I replied thus:

They claim that while they collect statistical info, they do not share 
your (possibly private) code itself... In any case, the code-base 
behind that website/app looks open-source, one can look through the 
code to see what it does.

In other words - one can do an audit of that website/app, before using it.

Thanks for voicing that concern. *smiley face*
