## Why I avoid LinkedIn as much as possible

I don't want ads. I didn't see any way to turn ads off - their policy 
translates as "your opt-out of ads is ineffective". 

I'm sick of feeling used (as a target for advertisements), as if I 
were a product. A saying goes, "If you're not paying for it, you're the 
product". 

Besides, I am growing to realise my data is valuable. Why should I give 
my data away for free? If they want to target ads towards me, they can 
buy some info about me - I kinda wanna make some $$$ from selling my 
data (a tongue-in-cheek statement, maybe)
