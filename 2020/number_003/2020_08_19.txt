## (satire) Should I do Tinder-driven career development?

So the objective of this exercise is to gather data on which tech 
companies are most attractive to girls on Tinder.

I will set up multiple Tinder accounts, each claiming that I work for a
respective company in GAFAM + FAANG: Google, Amazon, Facebook, 
Microsoft, Netflix, Apple.

To make things more interesting, let me create an corresponding Tinder 
account for each of the following Sg-based company:

- Aida Technologies Pte Ltd
- Tusitala (RLS) Pte Ltd

For each account, I will swipe right for 200 Tinder-girls, to indicate 
that I want to match with them.

I will check each account after 31 days, to see how many Tinder-girls 
agreed to match with me.

Then I will see which account has the most number of matches, and apply 
for a job at the tech company that I associated with the "winning" Tinder-account.

@obwama pointed out that attractiveness may vary based on age of user 
and time/day.

I'll be the first to admit that the above experiment falls short of 
scientific rigour. (I have half a mind to delete any mention of such
an experiment).

But we can say the same about dates "in real life". Attractiveness may 
vary based on the venue of the date, the menstrual cycle of the girl and so on.

So is the following statement still invariably true?  "holding a job 
at Google absolutely, always, unfailingly impresses 
Tinder dates".

I am trying to prove that such a statement is false.
I am thinking of trying something called "reductio ad absurdum": taking 
an argument to its logical extreme, and showing that such a logical 
extreme is absurd, and therefore the argument must be false.

But I'm a newcomer to reductio ad absurdum.
