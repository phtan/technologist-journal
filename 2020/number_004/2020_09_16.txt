### Recording or tracking movies I've watched

Why was I looking at Ruby on Rails?

I want to track movies I've watched. I know existing web-sites like 
icheckmovies.com and letterboxd.com.

But using those web-sites means that my data lives on their servers.

So I considered building my own movie-tracking website, with RoR.

Then I got too lazy to bother with security vulnerabilities related to 
RoR and rubygems.

So now, I've more or less settled on using MySQL to track my watched movies.

I just have to read up on SQL commands.

Something like the following should scratch my itch:

CREATE "Train to Busan 2" in TABLE "movies" 

CREATE "14 August 2020, Train to Busan 2" in TABLE "date_i_watched"

I figure I have no need for RoR, in this case.
