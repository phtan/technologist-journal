About Telegram and Rose

(Telegram is an app for chatting or specifically, Instant 
Messaging. Users of Telegram can enlist the help of Rose, a bot).

Rose can act against users who mention certain words. In other words, 
administrators of chat-groups can give Rose a black-list.

Administrators may command Rose as such:

/addblacklist "against online stuff"

So, great, someone enters in a chat-group, and says, "I am against 
online stuff". Rose then kicks him out of the group.

What does Rose say while doing so? Well, for example: 

"Another one bites the dust...!
Banned Edward.
Reason:
Automated blacklist action, due to a match on: against online stuff"

As you can see, Rose mentions which words we have in our black-list, 
i.e. "against online stuff".

What if we want Rose to keep our black-list secret? 

We can give Rose this command instead:

/addblacklist "against online stuff" "Rose is not telling you the banned words"

So, the next time Rose kicks someone out, we can expect Rose to say:

"Another one bites the dust...!
Banned Edward.
Reason:
Rose is not telling you the banned words"

Or, we can, just as easily, command Rose thus:

/addblacklist "against online stuff" "you done messed up, spammer. Bye!"
