### Alternatives to Github and Gitlab

We know Github is closed-source.

Some people are against closed-source software. Why so? Without going
into too much details, suffice to say - and I quote Mr. Aizat Faiz's
comment on such a topic (Aizat is apparently the creator of a web-site
called Deep Thought [1]) - "it gets deep". [2]

So, what gives?

Gitlab? (It seems open-source, but according to a netizen [3], 
contains proprietary, or closed-source, software)

How about neither of the above?

There are software that allows one to host a Github-like web-site.
What's more, these software are (F)OSS.

Gogs [4] and Gitea [5] - the latter is a fork of the former - are a few
of those.

And where may one find a web-site that runs, say, Gitea?

I can think of two:

- https://git.sdf.org/
- https://codeberg.org/

[2] Aizat has pointed me to a few points of (re)search:

- Eric Raymond, head of the Open Source Initiative
- Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux
- "a classic film, Revolution OS, from 2001, this was almost at the 
height of the open source vs proprietary software debate"
- BBC Documentary on Code Breakers
