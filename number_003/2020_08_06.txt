### Article in a journal

Ben Klemens. (2019). "Attributing Value to Patents and Trademarks in Complex Production 
Chains". In "Journal of the Knowledge Economy". Http://rdcu.be/b2xcR

My (somewhat incomplete) summary follows: 

textbooks teach that a patent makes 
money for the inventor. Mr. Ben Klemens claims that inventors can make 
money even without a patent; but Ben does distinguish between discrete 
products (e.g. the pharmaceutical product Prozac) and complex products 
(e.g. software).

### Program I've written

I welcome and would appreciate feedback on the code that can be viewed
at either of the following URLs:

- https://github.com/phtan/footoe
- https://codeberg.org/phtan/footoe

I'm new to Python and maybe I've misssed some conventions, or a so-called
"Pythonic way" of doing things.
