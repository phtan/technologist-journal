## here be a refuge in the Dhamma

The Buddha prescribes the following guidelines for exercising moral restraint and self-control:

1. Do not take life.
2. Do not take what is not given
3. Do not engage in sexual misconduct
4. Do not consume distilled and fermented drinks that lead to heedlessness, pain and despair
5. Do not speak lies and falsehood.

The Dhamma is immediate and effective, to be experienced by the wise, discerning, and intelligent, for themselves.
